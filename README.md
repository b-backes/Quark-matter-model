# Quark matter model
This repository contains codes used in nuclear astrophysics research, which were all developed by me. All of them revolve around the density dependent quark mass model to describe deconfined quark matter.

Most of the codes contained here are written in C, and some should be executed with ROOT (see https://root.cern/). Please refer to their website for instructions on how to install it if the codes you are interested in need depend on it.

You are free to utilise and modify them as you need. If you do so, I kindly request that you cite the respective original work.
